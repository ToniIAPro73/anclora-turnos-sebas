# Agent Skills

## Overview
A "Skill" in this repository represents a set of capabilities, logic, or utility functions that can be reused across the application or dedicated to a specific feature.

## Structure
- `/features/{feature-name}/README.md`: Documents the specific skills required for a feature.
- `/shared/`: Shared utilities and logic used globally.

## Usage
Agents should refer to the skills documentation to identify existing functions and logic before implementing new ones, ensuring they build upon the established foundations.
