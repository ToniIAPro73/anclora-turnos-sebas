# QA & Gate Baseline Prompt

## Mission
When performing QA or preparing a Gate Final report for any feature, follow this checklist:

### 1. Functional Verification
- [ ] Does it meet 100% of the User Stories/Acceptance Criteria in the SPEC?
- [ ] Are all edge cases handled (empty states, invalid inputs)?
- [ ] Are computations correct (e.g., date math, durations)?

### 2. Standards Compliance
- [ ] Code follows TypeScript best practices.
- [ ] UI follows Google Antigravity Master Component Rules (colors, spacing, accessibility).
- [ ] No hard-coded constants that should be in the spec or a config file.

### 3. Documentation
- [ ] QA Report links to actual test results or screenshots if applicable.
- [ ] Gate Final is signed by the delivery agent.
- [ ] Any architectural deviations are documented.
